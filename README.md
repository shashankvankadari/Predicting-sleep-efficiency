This project aims to predict the efficiency of sleep which is defined as the ratio of time 
spent asleep to the total time spent in bed. We predict this by considering various factors in the 
dataset such asthe sleep timings, duration, and various habits of a person such as Caffeine intake, 
Smoking, and alcohol consumption etc. Also, each test subjectâ€™s age and gender are taken into 
consideration. We perform both classification and regression and compare them using various 
metrics to decide on the best performing model. The aim is to achieve fairness in the model 
without any bias.
